Data Preparation and Integration Challenges
Missing Critical Fields:
Initial Kaggle datasets lacked key fields (e.g., pricing, ratings, links)
Transition to live APIs for data enrichment - API Limitations: API key constraints, rate limits, and restricted data retrieval

Embedding Challenges:
Complexity in chunking CSV files, storing embeddings
Difficulty connecting embeddings to LLMs for retrieval, especially with structured data
Multi-Agent Orchestration Challenges
Agent Coordination:
Difficulty integrating multiple agents for cohesive responses
Inconsistent results with frameworks (LangGraph, CrewAI, LlamaIndex Router)

Agent Issues:
langchain.experimental holds create_csv_agent which shows promising results, but its still under experimental. Identified its deprecated with lot of versions.

Orchestration Bottlenecks:
Lack of effective collaboration among agents
Challenges in multi-step queries and summarization

**Approached solutions:**
Chunking and Filtering:
Focused on cell phone data with 200+ records, rating > 3
Ensured mandatory fields: price, images, description
Fill missing data using LLMs

Agent approaches:
Adjustments in agent types (Zero Shot â†’ Conversational.React type agent)
Temperature setting (0.3) improved performance but not optimal

RAG system loopwholes:
Though RAG has promised lot of complex scenarios, it still fail to address context aware situations.
For eg, It has unable to detect the difference betweeen 128GB RAM vs 128GB storage.
Identified solution using Cosine similarity for word similarity of user based questions.
